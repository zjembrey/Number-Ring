This program reads the designated txt file,"COSC489_PT_2168_Input.txt" in this case, and creates a ring from the given numbers.
After setting up the ring it starts a loop that asks the user for input to choose a command and then calls that command on the number ring.
the user can insert a new number, append a number, delete the current targeted number, jump a certain amount of spaces on the ring,
sort the ring using the current target as the pivot point, and print out the number ring in a list.
